# Fairy

A source generator that generates C# code based on Sitecore Content Serialization (SCS) `.yml` files.

It was based on ideas and code from (all with MIT licensed):
- [Leprechaun](https://github.com/blipson89/Leprechaun) - code generation tool for Sitecore
- [Helixbase](https://github.com/muso31/Helixbase) - used mainly for testing
- [RainbowDataAnalyzer](https://github.com/hermanussen/RainbowDataAnalyzer) (my own project)
- [JsonByExampleGenerator](https://github.com/hermanussen/JsonByExampleGenerator/) (my own project)
