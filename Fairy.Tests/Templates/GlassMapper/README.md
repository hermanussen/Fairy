# Fairy Scriban template for GlassMapper

> :warning: This template has not been tested. It should be viewed as a base to start from.

This template generates GlassMapper classes with annotations, similar to how [Leprechaun](https://github.com/blipson89/Leprechaun/blob/dev/src/Leprechaun.CodeGen.Roslyn/Scripts/GlassMapper.csx) does this.

Check the readme in the root for instructions on how to use this (section "Use your own Scriban template instead of the default one").
